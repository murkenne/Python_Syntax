# Task 1 Grocery Store Math.
# Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store.
# Given their individual prices.

x = 12
y = 15
z = 27

total = x + y + z

# Calculate the total amount in your account after a year.

initialAmount = 27459
yearly_interest_rate = 0.07

interest = initialAmount * yearly_interest_rate
